Views Editor is a simple way for people to code on the web.

<h1>What is Views Editor</h1>

<p>Views Editor is a simple and easy way to write code. It will be created in HTML so it can be used anywhere. There will aslo be a Windows application that can be installed.</p>

<h1>Why Views? Whats Different?</h1>

<p>Views Editor can run almost anywhere without setup. Views also lets you set up a to do list so you know what tasks you have completed. You may also upload your template or design and view it on the same place as you code. You may also make Views Editor the way you want by modding the open source code.</p>

<h1>When Will Work Start? When Will I Be Able To Help? When Can I download?</h1>

<p>Sorry but I can't answer those questions just yet. I am currenly unaware of those dates.</p>

<h1>To Do</h1>

1. Create a start page which shows news
2. Make a simple textarea with syntax highlighting
3. Allow user to make multiple files. Each file will be seperate tab on the browser. The name of the file will be the tab name. 
4. Add to do list feature
5. Add view template button
6. Add code preview? - Is that needed?
